### 1. **Set up Python environment**

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
You can create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

---

### 2. **Install dependencies**

The main dependency is **OpenCV**. Install it with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

(If you face errors, you may also need `numpy`, but OpenCV usually brings it in automatically.)

---

### 3. **Check assets**

Inside the repo there’s an `assets/` folder with a sample video:
`assets/debris.mp4`

This is the input video that the script processes.

---

### 4. **Run the detection script**

Run the Python script provided:

```bash
python spaceDebrisDetection.py
```

---

### 5. **View results**

* A window will open showing the video with **detected debris marked in bounding boxes**.
* Press **q** to quit.

---

✅ That’s it — you’ll see simulated debris being detected in real-time from the video.

Do you want me to also write a **requirements.txt** file for this repo\*\* (so you can just do `pip install -r requirements.txt`)?
